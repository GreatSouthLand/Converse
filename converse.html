If Only Mind<br>
<br>
The howling wind around the trees<br>
into a smaller bush<br>
throughout the mournful day it groans<br>
into the darkest night<br>
<br>
The glass inside the window pane,<br>
it cries with awesome fright<br>
of the loneliness it wants to hide<br>
yet finds again cannot<br>
<br>
The night begins and starts to fall<br>
like a blanket of cold ice<br>
whose shroud exists in loneliness<br>
where all the stars unite<br>
<br>
The mountain path that leads away <br>
from that soul-less habitat<br>
is where beyond that every sun<br>
shines on and stays about<br>

The Intoxicated Trunk<br><br>Abraham and his pet mouse<br>lived in season in a kindly house<br>which stood upon the forest dunes<br>and played the surf on seaside tunes<br><br>The two would stand upon the beach<br>and watch the stars fly out of reach<br>and every time they heard their sound<br>they fell down laughing on the ground<br><br>The night was always fun for all<br>who waited and waited for the stars to fall<br>and though the others couldn't tell<br>a spray of stardust was what fell<br><br>So through the day and into the night<br>they'd stand and watch the stars in flight<br>which made them dance and happy and gay<br>for they were blessed in their way<br><br>Passing through the night time state<br>the dawning brought the sleepless gate<br>which opened outward to the view<br>and closed behind the world they knew<br><br>The eternity of endless night<br>had vanished from within their sight<br>and the two who always loved to play<br>were turned into another day

Lonely Cove
<br>
<br>Just when one night as I quietly crept
<br>there resounded an echo of someone who wept
<br>I was then set astray by that soulful noise
<br>and hearkened the call which had made me poise
<br>
<br>Looking beneath me so low that I bowed
<br>when all at once I heard out aloud
<br>Everyone there 'cept myself all alone
<br>cry for the light in a solitary moan
<br>
<br>I left there at once to take my last chance
<br>of finally losing all sight of that trance
<br>"I've fallen for it all" I then realized
<br>until I found out that everyone lies

Apparently There
<br>
<br>I sang my song on the funeral ground
<br>where nobody came to discover the sound
<br>No-one wished me luck with my choice for
<br>they weren't so worried, I had a new voice
<br>
<br>Yet those solitary vows I made to myself
<br>never came down from their place on the shelf
<br>They were left there alone with the broken down gun
<br>they had given to me for a piece of their fun
<br>
<br>I could not feel that now to begin
<br>was time enough to smile with a grin
<br>So when I told you, the one I won't like
<br>you stood there in shock, "wasn't that right?"
<br>
<br>None of them knew, I'd like to tell you
<br>just what it was like to be so blue
<br>Since I was here I got into strife
<br>that funeral ground was just my life
<br>
<br>And when I left there, I also lost all
<br>of the lonely surrounds this side of the wall
<br>I thank them now for that piece of mind
<br>they loaned me in trust when I was still blind

Propheteering<br><br>I saw your eyes, there – a sparkling green<br>they're wandering though the velvet dream<br>I watch as you speak with a voice, soft delight<br>and quiver throughout and all through that night<br><br>At last I can share all from your heart<br>and the growing despair now can take part <br>To speak – as I say all that is true<br>and to hear what is right for that is from you<br><br>To see – what I saw, as a wondrous sight<br>and behold in my eyes all that I might <br>And send with a sigh all that could tell<br>of how I am high and over that hell

Going On

Blues Lost
<br>
<br>By myself I went 
<br>to the countryside
<br>away from all the world
<br>and there I found my solitude,
<br>the place in which to hide
<br>
<br>With grasses green
<br>the breeze did blow
<br>across my woeful face
<br>I had found my rest and peace of mind
<br>in this lonely place
<br>
<br>I didn't try 
<br>to think of why
<br>I left my old abode
<br>all I knew, in my rested mind
<br>was to watch myself unload
<br>
<br>Then at night
<br>I realized
<br>what had become of me
<br>the sun had gone and in its place
<br>were only starry skies
<br>
<br>The tears I wept
<br>were all in vain
<br>the world had said to me
<br>so I leaped into a bound you know
<br>they thought I was insane

Vision 101 / Back Step<br><br>Humble down, stumble down, hangin' on high<br>rockin' on the round, all but getting by
